## Monitoring Script

### Purpose

The **Monitoring Script** helps in tracking key system metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and latency. It is intended to detect performance anomalies and notify administrators when thresholds are breached, enabling proactive intervention.

### Features

- Tracks CPU and memory usage in real-time.
- Monitors latency and other performance-related parameters.
- Configurable alert thresholds that send notifications when metrics exceed safe levels.
- Generates log files for performance analysis and debugging.

### Usage

1. **Configure thresholds**: Set alert thresholds for CPU usage, memory consumption, and latency within the script as needed.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the script in your terminal or as a scheduled task to continuously monitor system performance.
3. **View logs**: Monitor logs generated by the script to track performance over time and analyze trends.

```bash
Monitoring.py
```

## Optimization Script

### Purpose

The **Optimization Script** focuses on automating key system optimizations to improve performance and resource management. It works by identifying and addressing resource-heavy processes, redistributing workloads, and optimizing memory and CPU usage.

### Features

- Identifies and terminates resource-intensive processes exceeding predefined limits.
- Implements load-balancing logic to distribute workloads evenly.
- Periodic memory cleanup to prevent resource bottlenecks.
- Logs performance optimization actions for review.

### Usage

1. **Set optimization parameters**: Customize thresholds for CPU and memory usage optimization in the script.
2. **Run the script**: Execute it in your environment to monitor and optimize resource usage automatically.
3. **Analyze logs**: Review optimization actions in log files to understand performance improvements.

```bash
Optimization.py
```

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DinukiM/System-Monitoring-.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Python installed. Additional libraries may be required based on the scriptâ€™s functionality, which can be installed via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure alert and optimization thresholds**:

    Modify the variables in each script to set thresholds for CPU, memory, and latency according to your environment needs.
